"""ONNX execution-provider coordinator: GPU/CPU state machine + auto-promote/demote.

Owns provider state for one analysis run. The ``SpeciesNetSAMHQWrapper`` consults
this object to decide which providers a fresh ``InferenceSession`` should request,
and to react to inference failures by recreating sessions on a different provider.

Failure modes handled:
- DML "GPU device instance has been suspended" (Windows OOM / driver reset).
- CoreML cold-start "model_path must not be empty" (macOS first-run path loss).
- DXGI device removed / hung / reset.

Policy (tuned for typical 1000-image folders):
- Start in ``GPU`` if user enabled GPU, else ``CPU`` (and never promote).
- A "session-dead" exception in ``GPU`` demotes to ``CPU`` and asks the wrapper to
  recreate every loaded session.
- After ``initial_promote_threshold`` consecutive successful CPU images, attempt
  one promotion back to ``GPU``. If that promotion (or the next inference) fails,
  demote again and double the threshold (capped). After
  ``max_demotions_before_lockout`` demote events, transition to ``GPU_LOCKED_OUT``
  and stay on CPU for the rest of the run.

This module is single-thread by design — the analysis pipeline processes images
sequentially. If parallel-image processing is ever introduced, add a lock around
``on_run_success`` / ``on_run_failure`` / ``attempt_promotion``.
